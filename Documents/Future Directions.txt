As the program becomes more refined, and data collection and analysis are improved including the incorporation of system logs, automation of  optimization based on the use of the system can be accurately identified. Reducing performance degradation by automating exact maintenance essentials therefore also saving time. Increasing performance overall by exacting usage and system necessities to reduce system resource consumption enabling computational power to be reserved for specific usage.  Allow the system heightened flexibility by providing usage recalibration in regards to performance, security and data management. Reducing the need for costly technical servicing.
